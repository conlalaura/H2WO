                Public restrooms play a critical role in creating inclusive spaces, especially when tailored to diverse needs. From wheelchair accessibility to the presence of gender-neutral facilities, restroom attributes can significantly impact the comfort and ease of use for different individuals. Many facilities offer free access, which reduces barriers for users, while the availability of changing tables seems to be limited. However, it's important to note that the available data is limited.
